# jobListing-Project
<br>
Through this project I aimed to enhance my proficiency in Java by gaining a deeper understanding of its intricacies and capabilities, whilst also exploring how to work with RESTful APIs, recognising their pivotal role in modern software development. Additionally, I used Swagger UI as a way to provide a visual representation of the program's data retrieval capabilities.

## HTTP Request Methods

Here I use the Swagger UI as a dynamic interface to engage with the Java Program. The Swagger UI allows me to assess the accuracy of HTTP methods, in terms of both desired outcomes and response codes.

## Get Posts

In this image, I executed a test involving the GET request method, aimed at retrieving all job posts from the MongoDB database. The successful outcome is evident in the image, where the '200' response code signifies successful retrieval, and the response body highlights evidence of the delivered dataset, fully meeting the requirements.

## Post Job

Second Image
<br>
In the first image, I executed a test using the POST request method to append a new job entry to the MongoDB database. The result comes to light in the second image, where a '200' response code validates the success of the operation, concurrently revealing the content that has been added to the database.
