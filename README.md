Through this project I aimed to enhance my proficiency in Java by gaining a deeper understanding of its intricacies and capabilities, whilst also exploring how to work with RESTful APIs, recognising their pivotal role in modern software development. Additionally, I used Swagger UI as a way to provide a visual representation of the program's data retrieval capabilities.
